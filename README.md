# python-app-1
My first Python app for college.

## Installation Requirements
Make sure that you have PyGame and NumPy downloaded. Everything else should be standard.

## Credits
I learned a lot by watching tutorials on YouTube (sometimes hour+ long videos) and reading articles from online. The only code I used online was basic standard code which I learned from, and completely re-coded for my project specifically. For example, I learned how to create a Button class in Python from a YouTube video. However, I completely rewrote the Button class to work for my project specifically.

Both of the simulations in this submission (Vector Field + Fireworks) were adapated from JavaScript projects that I made several years ago. Of course, I had to rewrite everything in Python, but a lot of the basic algorithms applied so I thought I would mention that.

I should also mention that the two fonts I used were from a free site (DaFonts). Additionally, I made most of the images used (for the butons), but the background image was taken from an online tutorial so I assume that makes it fine to use, although I can always find another background image or make my own.
